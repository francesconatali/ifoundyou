# ifoundyou
An interesting web app created with ReactJS, JSX, Axios and Google Map.

Given an email address, the app makes use of the Full Contact API to find all the informations available for that user: Avatar, name, current job, company, location, gender, age range and bio.

It works very well with company email addresses. Try it with yours!

Moreover, ALL the dependencies are WITHIN the html file, using simply a bunch of URLs.

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.0.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios@0.16.2/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```

No need for web server, Node, create-react-app, and its zillion dependencies. Download it on your computer and directly open it in your browser and it will work.
